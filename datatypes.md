# Data Types

## The basic data types

Just as in `numpy`, C-like languages 

- `char` for ASCII characters
- `int` (and friends) for integers.
- `float` for lower precision numbers
- `double` for higher precision numbers
- `void` for "nothing"

## Extended types

## Scope, declarations, definitions & initialization 

Where Python lets its objects switch between types, C-like languages make programmers state the type of a variable, which cannot be changed while that variable is accessible by that name. The limits of accessibility of a variable is sometimes called its "scope", and is usually defined as the narrowest `{  }` block the variable is exposed in.
