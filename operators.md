# C/C++ Operators
```{index} operators
```

## The Basic Operations
```{index} operators: basic
```

Like Python, C-like languages support the core mathematical operations on numerical data types, be they varables, or literals (i.e. symbols like `3` or `4.6754`). You can do any of the following:


|Operator| Operation |
|:------:|:---------:|
|   +    |  Addition |
|   -    | Subtraction|
|   *    | Multiplication|
|   /    | Division   |

Unlike Python there is no exponentiation operator (i.e. no `**`), which requires a function call instead.

## Logical Operators
```{index} operators: logical
```

Again, as with Python, all the binary logical operators below work in C/C++

|Operator| Operation |
|:------:|:---------:|
|   ==   |  equality test |
|   >    | greater than|
|   <    | less than|
|       | Division   |

## Other Useful Operators
```{index} operators: other
```

## Operators For Completionists
```{index} operators: advanced
```

## The Order of Evaluation
```{index} evaluation order
```
