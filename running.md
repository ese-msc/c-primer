# Compiling & Running C/C++ Programs
```{index} compiling
```

Whereas python is extremely simple to get working with, C & C++ have a few extra hurdles. Your program must be compiled (and sometimes linked to other libraries) before it can be run. In this section we present a number of ways of approaching this, listed in order of ease of use.

## Web based solutions
```{index} compiling:web-based 
```

There are a variety of platforms which will allow you to run small one file C & C++ programs or code snippets directly from your browser. A (non-exhaustive) list of examples includes:
- replit.com
- http://codepad.org/
- https://ideone.com/

## Using VS code & .devcontainers
```{index} compiling: via docker
```


## Compiling natively

### Windows: Visual Studio
```{index} compiling:windows
```

For Windows users only, you can obtain the Microsoft C/C++ compiler by downloading the Visual Studio community package [here](). Visual Studio is a sister package to Visual Studio Code, which combines build tools for several programming languages with an Integrating Development Environment (IDE) to code them in.

### Apple Macs: `gcc`
```{index} compiling:mac
``` 

#### VS code

#### Xcode
